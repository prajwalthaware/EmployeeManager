# EmployeeManager
During my internship, I developed a Java-based application for [insert purpose, e.g., "managing employee records in a small HR system"]. The application includes features like CRUD operations, search functionality, and basic authentication. It uses Java with JDBC for database connectivity and Swing for the GUI.
